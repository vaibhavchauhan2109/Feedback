I wish to complain about your postpaid serivce that Im using for last two years.  Day by day its becoming very bad . There is signal issue everwhere, not only from my house, but from most of the locations.  I have contacted your call center multiple times , and was told that nothing could be done about my problem. Ths response is very unfair. The phone signal is very poor inside my house. Im really disappointed with your service.

I would like a written statement explaining your company's position and what you will do about my complaint.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible to resolve this problem. If I do not hear from you within 2 days, I will be moving to another service provider and also will close all the other services im holding with you like Broadband connection and Digital service.
